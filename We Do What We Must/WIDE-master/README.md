# WIDE Hackathon

This is the project created between 26th and 27th of October at the Wide Open Science Hackathon by team We Do What We Must.

The app uses D3.js to visualize connections between different concepts related to a keyword supplied by the user. The app taps into the open APIs for the [YSO vocabulary](https://api.finto.fi/) as well as [Finna](https://www.kiwi.fi/display/Finna/Finnan+avoin+rajapinta).

To run the browser interface please open index.html in a browser. The interface has only been tested in Firefox 63.0. Please note that you must refresh the page between each query.

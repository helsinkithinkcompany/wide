## MOTIVATION

- To help students with two stages in the their research â€” looking how much resources they can expect to find at an institution and how their focus on the subject of interest changed over time, and to more easily explore commonly researched work

## BUBBLE DESCRIPTION

- To better visualize the relative proportion of publications by institution for each year and how they change in publication activity over time â€” larger bubbles denote a higher proportion.

## CO MAT DESCRIPTION

- Given a user query as subject, the top 10 keywords that are also used in different papers that contain the user query and this heat map shows the co occurrence of the keyword pairs â€” how often they appear together in a single publication. Lighter color denotes higher frequency â€” in this example, the subject keyword eeg is very commonly seen the subject keyword electroencephalography

## FUTURE WORK

- normalize the proportions across all time bc different total publications from every year
- API: try with publishDate and see the difference of number in results
- Add more informative features to these visualizations e.g. interactive click for list of publications for more info, labels, legends
